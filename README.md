**/dashboard And /dashboard?date=YYYY-MM-DD**

The dashboard page displays reservations for a specific date defaulted to today's date with the ability to move forwards and backward day by day. The page only displays reservations if they are not "finished".

**/reservations/reservation_id/seat**

The seat page displays a form for assigning a reservation to a table at the restaurant. This page is routed to by clicking the seat button on a 'booked' reservation. On a click of the seat button the reservation's status is updated to 'seated'. The given table will then show 'occupied' and a finish button will appear on the table row. When the restaurant user is ready to finish a table clicking the finish button will update a table's status to 'free' and the attached reservation's status to 'finished' and remove that given reservation from the dashboard's view.
